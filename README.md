# Motivation and Problem Statement
Every year there are more electric and self driving vehicles on the roads, and an important part of these vehicles is ensuring the occupants and other drivers' safety.
A major part of this safety guarantee comes in the form of reliable hazard detection and taking possible preventative measures based on that data.
For our project we wanted to explore how this hazard detection can be completed through the means of computer vision using machine learning.\\
We set out to make a simple model that could detect multiple different types of hazards from input images, and we later explored using an established model and a 
large dataset to achieve more hazard and road feature identification for both images and video inputs.
